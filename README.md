## Why Use AI Agent Workflows?

**Stop context switching. Start delivering.**

Traditional development often involves jumping between planning, coding, reviewing, and testing without proper documentation or systematic approach. This leads to:

- ‚ùå Lost context between development phases
- ‚ùå Inconsistent code quality and review processes  
- ‚ùå Missing documentation and decision rationale
- ‚ùå Inefficient handoffs between team members
- ‚ùå Repeated mistakes and forgotten lessons learned

**AI Agent Workflows solve this by providing:**

- ‚úÖ **Systematic Documentation** - Every ticket maintains its own complete documentation trail
- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Efficiency** - Leverage Claude Code and Windsurf for intelligent automation
- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance** - Built-in code review and QA validation processes
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Process** - Standardized workflows across all development work
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Retention** - Capture decisions, research, and lessons learned
- ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration** - Clear handoff points and shared understanding

## Quick Start

Get started in 3 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install globally
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/agent-workflows.git
cd agent-workflows
./install-global-workflows.sh

# 2. Create your first ticket
./create-ticket.sh PROJECT-123

# 3. Start development with AI assistance
# In Windsurf: Use planning workflows for requirements and research
# In Claude Code: Use /execute PROJECT-123 for implementation
```

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** - AI-powered development environment
- **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** - Code editor with AI planning capabilities
- **Git** - Version control system
- **Bash** - Shell environment (Linux/macOS/WSL)

### Optional but Recommended
- **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)** - For pull request management
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** - For end-to-end testing (QA phase)

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL
- Node.js 18+ (if working with JavaScript/TypeScript projects)
- Git 2.20+
- Bash 4.0+

## How It Works

AI Agent Workflows follows a **4-phase development process** with dedicated tools for each phase:

```
üìã Planning ‚Üí üîß Implementation ‚Üí üëÄ Review ‚Üí ‚úÖ QA
   Windsurf      Claude Code      Claude Code   Claude Code
```

Each ticket maintains its own directory with structured documentation, ensuring nothing is lost and everything is traceable.

### Core Concepts

1. **Ticket-Based Organization** - Each task gets its own directory with structured files
2. **Phase-Specific Tools** - Different AI tools optimized for different development phases  
3. **Living Documentation** - Files are updated throughout the development process
4. **AI Command Integration** - Custom commands that understand your project context

## Why Windsurf for Planning?

**The right tool for the right phase.**

While both Windsurf and Claude Code are powerful AI development tools, they excel in different areas. Here's why we strategically use each tool for specific phases:

### üß† Windsurf's Planning Advantages

**Local Codebase Intelligence**
- **Deep code indexing** - Windsurf maintains a comprehensive understanding of your entire codebase
- **Contextual awareness** - Better at understanding relationships between files, functions, and architecture
- **Efficient exploration** - Superior for browsing and analyzing existing code patterns

**Research & Analysis Optimized**
- **Plan mode** - Designed for systematic thinking without premature execution  
- **Multi-file analysis** - Excellent at understanding complex codebases and dependencies
- **Architecture comprehension** - Better at grasping high-level system design and integration points

**Collaborative Planning**
- **Interactive workflows** - Built-in workflows guide systematic requirements gathering
- **Documentation generation** - Optimized for creating comprehensive research and planning documents
- **Decision tracking** - Better at capturing and organizing planning decisions and rationale

### ‚ö° Claude Code's Implementation Advantages

**Execution Optimized**
- **Code modification focus** - Designed specifically for writing, editing, and refactoring code
- **Tool integration** - Superior integration with development tools (git, testing, linting)
- **Performance focus** - Optimized for rapid code changes and validation

**Implementation Workflow**
- **TDD support** - Better at following test-driven development practices
- **Systematic execution** - Excellent at methodically implementing planned changes
- **Quality assurance** - Built-in support for code review and testing workflows

### üéØ Strategic Tool Alignment

This two-tool approach creates a more efficient workflow:

1. **Windsurf handles exploration** - Use when you need to understand, research, and plan
2. **Claude Code handles execution** - Use when you're ready to implement, test, and deploy
3. **Complementary strengths** - Each tool's capabilities enhance the other's effectiveness
4. **Context preservation** - Documentation bridges between tools, maintaining continuity

**Result:** You get the best of both worlds - thoughtful planning with efficient execution.

## Installation

### Automatic Global Installation (Recommended)

The installation script automatically sets up workflows and commands for all your projects:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/agent-workflows.git
cd agent-workflows

# Run the interactive installer
./install-global-workflows.sh
```

The installer will:
- Create global directories (`~/.windsurf/workflows`, `~/.claude/commands`)
- Copy workflow files to the appropriate locations
- Prompt before overwriting existing files
- Verify installation success

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Windsurf workflows
mkdir -p ~/.windsurf/workflows
cp windsurf-workflows/* ~/.windsurf/workflows/

# Claude commands  
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp claude-commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Verification

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check workflow files are in place
ls ~/.windsurf/workflows/
ls ~/.claude/commands/

# Test ticket creation
./create-ticket.sh TEST-001
ls TEST-001/
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

```bash
# Create ticket for new feature
./create-ticket.sh FEAT-456

# Phase 1: Planning (in Windsurf)
# - Use /requirements workflow to analyze requirements
# - Use /research workflow to analyze codebase  
# - Use /planning workflow to create implementation plan

# Phase 2: Implementation (in Claude Code)
/execute FEAT-456

# Phase 3: Review (in Claude Code, after creating PR)
/pr-review 123

# Phase 4: QA (in Claude Code)
/qa-check 123
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```bash
# Create ticket for bug fix
./create-ticket.sh BUG-789

# Quick combined planning (in Windsurf)
/project-planning BUG-789

# Implement fix (in Claude Code)
/execute BUG-789

# Address PR feedback (in Claude Code)
/address-pr-comments 124
```

- **`qa.md`** - Business logic validation, user workflow testing, deployment readiness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Commands not found after installation**
```bash
# Restart your editors
# For Windsurf: Restart the application
# For Claude Code: Start a new session

# Verify installation
ls ~/.windsurf/workflows/ ~/.claude/commands/
```

**Q: Ticket creation fails**
```bash
# Check script permissions
chmod +x create-ticket.sh

# Verify current directory is writable
ls -la
```

**Q: Workflows not appearing in Windsurf**
```bash
# Check workflow directory
ls ~/.windsurf/workflows/

# Ensure files have correct extension (.md for Windsurf workflows)
```

**Q: Claude commands not working**
```bash
# Verify command files are properly formatted YAML
cat ~/.claude/commands/execute.yaml

# Check for syntax errors in YAML files
```

### Performance Tips

- Use workflows in **parallel** when possible (multiple Claude Code sessions)
- **Batch similar operations** within each phase for efficiency
- **Start with smaller tickets** to establish workflow patterns
- **Keep ticket directories organized** and clean up completed work
