# Planning Workflow

This workflow guides you through creating a detailed implementation plan for a ticket/task based on the completed requirements analysis and research.

## Steps

1. **Review Previous Phases**
   - Review the ticket description file (`[TICKET-ID].md`)
   - Analyze the research findings in `research.md`
   - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of both requirements and technical context

2. **Define Implementation Scope**
   - Clearly define what is in-scope and out-of-scope for this implementation
   - Identify specific features or functionality to be delivered
   - Note any constraints or limitations to acknowledge

3. **Design Technical Approach**
   - Choose an implementation approach from the options identified during research
   - Document the technical architecture or design patterns to be used
   - Create diagrams or visual aids if helpful for understanding

4. **Map Required Changes**
   - List all files that will need to be modified
   - Identify new files or components that need to be created
   - Document APIs that will be affected or created
   - Note any database changes or migrations needed

5. **Develop Implementation Steps**
   - Break down the implementation into sequential, manageable steps
   - Provide a suggested order of operations
   - Consider dependencies between different parts of the implementation

6. **Identify Potential Risks**
   - Highlight areas of technical complexity or uncertainty
   - Identify potential performance impacts
   - Note any security considerations
   - Consider backward compatibility issues
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases

7. **Define Testing Strategy**
   - Outline unit test requirements
   - Plan for integration testing needs
   - Identify any specialized testing tools or approaches needed

8. **Document the Plan**
   - Create or update `plan.md` with all planning information
   - Include:
     - Overview of approach
     - Detailed implementation steps
     - Files to be modified
     - Risk assessment
     - Testing approach
     - Estimated effort or complexity

Upon completion of this workflow, you should have:
1. A comprehensive implementation plan in `plan.md`
2. Clear guidance for the execution phase
3. Identification of potential risks and how to mitigate them
