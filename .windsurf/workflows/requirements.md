# Requirements Analysis

This workflow guides you through analyzing requirements for a ticket/task to ensure complete understanding before proceeding with implementation.

## Steps

1. **Locate and Review the Ticket Description**
   - Navigate to the ticket folder (`./[TICKET-ID]/`)
   - Open and review the main ticket description file (`[TICKET-ID].md`)
   - Identify key requirements, acceptance criteria, and any constraints

2. **Analyze Missing Information**
   - Create a list of any unclear requirements or missing details
   - Note questions that need clarification from stakeholders
   - Identify potential edge cases that aren't addressed in the requirements

3. **Research Related Components**
   - Use code search to identify components affected by the task
   - Look for similar past implementations or related documentation
   - Note any dependencies or integration points

4. **Gather Additional Information**
   - Prepare questions for stakeholders based on your analysis
   - Document answers and clarifications received
   - Update your understanding of requirements based on new information

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the ticket description file with any new information
   - Document any decisions made during the analysis
   - Ensure all requirements are clear, specific, and testable
   - Note any potential challenges or risks identified

6. **Prepare for Research Phase**
   - Create or update `research.md` with initial findings
   - Identify specific areas that need deeper technical research
   - Outline questions to answer in the research phase

Upon completion of this workflow, you should have:
1. A complete understanding of the requirements
2. Clear documentation with all necessary details
3. A solid foundation for the research and planning phases
